Requirements: In order to have the appscore icon show the correct appscore you need to
              have your website allow cross origin resources from www.appbackr.com
		
 	      In order to get any proper information out of this API, this API  must 
	      use android_id of any google.

	      You need to include the following javascript/css files (unless you already
	      have jquery and bootstrap) This version of fancy box must be included.

Quick start:
	include:
   	 <link href= "bootstrap/CSS/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
   	 <link href= "fancybox/source/jquery.fancybox.css" rel="stylesheet">
    	 <script src="bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
   	 <script src="jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
  	 <script src="fancybox/source/jquery.fancybox.pack.js"></script>
   	 <script src="fancybox/source/helpers/jquery.fancybox-buttons.js"></script>
   	 <script src="fancybox/source/helpers/jquery.fancybox-media.js"></script>
 	 <script src="fancybox/source/helpers/jquery.fancybox-thumbs.js"></script>
 	 <script src="appscoreAPI.js"></script>


	Call the any of the following functions in javascript:
	appscoreID(htmlId, android_id,top,left)
	appscoreClass(htmlClass, android_id,top,left)
	appscoreBody(android_id,top,left)

Notes:  If you don’t wish to use the appscore icon and only want to use the webpage
        linking to a particular data point use the url 
	“https://www.appbackr.com/XchangeApi/Appscore?id={android_id here}“
	example: https://www.appbackr.com/XchangeApi/Appscore?id=com.rovio.angrybirds

	There is a sample version of this code working in the include called “test.html”
